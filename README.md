## Overview — Daily-Quest

Daily-Quest is a social game where every day you face a new dilemma.
Each day, players are presented with a thought-provoking or funny scenario and must choose between multiple options. After voting, you instantly see how your choice compares to the community.

The app is designed to spark reflection, humor, and debate. Sometimes the questions are lighthearted, sometimes they’re controversial — but they’re always engaging.

## Why Daily-Quest?

It’s quick, fun, and makes you think. In less than a minute, you can make your choice, compare with others, and even spark deeper conversations. Daily-Quest turns simple questions into social experiments — blending entertainment with insight.
